# Notifications-Desktop

This program is designed to serve as a basic pomodoro timer. Upon initialization, the class prompts the user with the question "For what purpose will you start the pomodoro?". The program then asks "How many seconds or minutes would you like the pomodoro to run?". Once the duration and unit of time are specified, a desktop notification is displayed to signal the start. Upon completion, another notification is displayed to indicate that the pomodoro has finished.
